# dow - Drift Observation Workbench

Track how your AI's behavior changes across versions. Version the complete
inference specification (prompt, model identity and version, sampling settings,
evaluation configuration), execute it, and measure semantic drift, stability, and
regressions between versions - with causal attribution. Versioning is automatic
and Git is a hidden storage backend; you never run git commands.

See [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md) for the full design.

## Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate            # Windows
pip install -e .
```

Optional providers:

```bash
pip install -e ".[openai]"        # hosted models and embeddings
pip install -e ".[local]"         # local sentence-transformers embeddings
```

## Use

```bash
dow run            # first run scaffolds specs/summarization.yaml + evals.py; run again to capture v1
# edit specs/summarization.yaml (e.g. change temperature)
dow run            # captures v2 (custom metrics run automatically)
dow compare        # v1 vs v2: output diff + drift + stability + verdict (defaults to last two)
dow explain        # why behavior changed: attributes it to a config field
dow tag good v1    # label a version (good, golden, baseline, bad, ...)
dow eval           # run your custom metrics; compare vs previous and last-good
dow history        # list captured versions, stability, and tags
dow inspect v1     # one version's spec, runtime capture, outputs, tags, eval
dow tree           # visualize how behavior evolves across versions
dow tree -o evolution.md   # export a Mermaid diagram; open the Markdown preview
```

Versions are named automatically (v1, v2, ...); refer to them by name, the
shortcuts `last` and `prev`, or any label you applied with `dow tag`. They form
a tree - `dow run --from v1` branches from an earlier version. Runs fully
offline by default (mock provider + built-in hashing embedder); no API key
required.

## Custom metrics

Plug in your own evaluators - plain functions that receive an `EvalContext` and
return a score or named scores - and reference them from the spec:

```yaml
evaluation:
  metrics:
    - evals.py:avg_word_count      # local file : function
    - my_pkg.metrics:accuracy      # importable module : function
```

```python
# evals.py
def avg_word_count(ctx):
    return sum(len(o.split()) for o in ctx.outputs) / max(1, len(ctx.outputs))
```

`dow eval` runs them, saves the scores with the version, and compares against
the previous version and the last one you tagged (`dow tag good`). Evaluation
is automatic on `dow run` and reused thereafter unless you pass `--rerun`.
